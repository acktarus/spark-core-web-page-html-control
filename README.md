spark-core-web-page-html-control
================================

Example control of the spark core and perhaps photon with a simple html web page 



Dec 12, 2014  Can't really believe that it worked, but it does. You need to find your access token in the spark settings page at the bottom left of your spark IDE screen.

You then need the Core Device ID which is harder to find. You have to go to the core then click on your cores ">" sign beside the flashing blue dot.

Then just call the function you want to activate. Travels at the speed of your connection which can be fast or up to a few seconds.


Wow. Very happy.
